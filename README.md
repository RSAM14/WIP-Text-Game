# WIP-Text-Game
This is a text-based game I am making to learn python and coding.

The idea was to create a one-player rpg style game, similar to Dungeons and Dragons, revolving around user text inputs. 
The user would have a character with stats and will go through encounters.
Encouters will be made so that they can be added almost seperately from the main program.

Currently, the inputs are:
-a name, this can be anything
-stats, this limited to the given numbers
-classes, this is case sensitive and limited to the given classes
-player option, currently limited to "attack"
-select target, limited to list of remaining enemies and isnt case sensitive
-select stat improvement, limited to options give, isnt case sensitve
-play again, yes or no
