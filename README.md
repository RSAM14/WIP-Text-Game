# WIP-Text-Game
This is a text-based game I am making to learn python and coding.

The idea was to create a one-player rpg style game, similar to Dungeons and Dragons, revolving around user text inputs. 
The user would have a character with stats and will go through encounters.
Encouters will be made so that they can be added almost seperately from the main program.
